# ARACHNIDA

Introductory project to web scraping and metadata. I also took the opportunity to learn more about Python programming
<br/><br/>

## WHAT IS WEB SCRAPING?
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites, and it enables data collection from websites for use in research, market analysis, data mining, or content aggregation, but it must be done responsibly.

### WHAT IS METADATA?

Metadata is information which purpose is to describe other data. Itâ€™s essentially data about data. It is frequently used to describe information contained on images and documents, and can reveal sensitive information about those who have created or manipulated them
<br/><br/>

### USAGE

- Clone the repository `git clone`
- Run the `spider.py [URL]` to extract image files from the given URL. You can use some flags, run `spider.py -h` for more details
- After the spider script stops, you can run `scorpion.py [IMAGE_PATH]` to extract all existent metadata from a file
